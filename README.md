# Ali the Android

Distant-future sci-fi narrative horror roguelike/metroidvania fusion built around learning/mastering abilities.

# Game Design

- **Goal:** Ship something small, like *really* small. Fuse metroidvania with roguelike.

- 10 floors in total
	- The first eight floors are four pairs of new-skill, master-skill
	- The ninth floor combines everything together
	- The tenth/final floor adds a final boss
- User experience goals:
  - Feels like an awesome, strategic UX. You die because you made a mistake.
  - At the same time, when you win, you feel really smart/powerful/innovative.
- The four skills for the four floors:
	- Charge attack (waits a turn, additional knockback and maybe splash)
	- Mini-missile (breaks breakable walls, explosion damage)
	- Electric (bounces to nearby enemies, can short-circuit/unlock doors)
	- Forcefield (damages in a circle around you and pushes enemies away)
	- Plasma rifle (3-4 shots on one target)
- Other traversal upgrades:
	- Teleport drone (shoot it 3-5 squares away to teleport there, hits walls though)
	- Anti-toxic suit upgrade for deep levels
- Backtracking is encouraged to get stuff

## THEMES
- Theme should fit the core gameplay. which is what?
- Descending. Exploring.
- Killing monsters that kill you.
- Finding and assimilating alien technology.

## STORY
- The Khalifah sends you to a derelict space station in the middle of deep space
- This station was a research station. They were researching some sort of cure
- Communication went dark a couple of weeks ago. No messages.
- You arrive and find it busted up - debris (breakable walls), no power (locked doors), plasma drive leaks (plasma rooms)
- NB: first floor with plasma, AI voice in ear says "be careful Trace, I detect plasma waves."
- NB: once assimilated, voice should tell you "oh I can do X things now" eg. destroy debris or teleport gaps or whatever

## DATA CUBES BELOW
- It's my first day at Umbrella Corporation. They're building a super-healing thing. Excitement - because Qur'an teaches us, to save one life is to save humanity
- There was an accident. Was it sabotaged? Somehow, the prototype leaked, and affected a couple of the crew.
- It's not a cure. It's a weapon. We told the Ameer, he KNEW from the start. Doesn't he know that he will be taken to account on the Day of Reckoning?
- The cure, the delivery mechanism is an air-borne virus. It's in the vents. It's everywhere.
- I'm infected too, I can feel my senses sharpening, my brain slowing down, what am I turning into ... ?!
- The guards - they turned into Zugs. They blew out the engine ... (plasma wave warning)
- The Ameer holed himself up on the last floor. He may still be there ... 
- I am the last one left. The Ameer is the worst mutant of all. He got infected, he self-generates ... [shahadah]

## ENDING
- You find a last vial of the cure. Khalifah says: destroy it, it's too dangerous to risk! You say: ...
