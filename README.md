# Space Marine Junaid

Distant-future sci-fi ASCII roguelike/metroidvania fusion built around learning/mastering abilities.

# Content + Spoilers

- **Goal:** Ship something small, like *really* small. Fuse metroidvania with roguelike.

- Backstory: ship attacked, crashed on planet, beat the queen (maybe she stole a critical ship part).
- 10 floors in total
	- The first eight floors are four pairs of new-skill, master-skill
	- The ninth floor combines everything together
	- The tenth/final floor adds a final boss

- The four skills for the four floors:
	- Charge attack (waits a turn, additional knockback and maybe splash)
	- Bomb attack: bombs an area around you and destroys walls/blocks
	- Rocket: like a launchable bomb, explosive area damage
	- Freeze: 
		- Freezes enemies (unkillable shadows who don't die but disappear when out-of-sight)
		- When shot over liquids (lava/water), freezes them for a few turns
	- (optional) space jump: jumps ~3 tiles.
	- Other optional upgrades like health, power/damage, etc.
- Backtracking
  - Floors < bomb floor, which have bomb-locked doors
  - Floors < rocket floor, which have rocket-locked doors
  - Floors < freeze floor, which have lava-surrounded doors
  - Make sure at least one of these is necessary to succeed (eg. put the rocket behind a bomb door and freeze behind a rocket-door) but make sure backtracking is either fun or quick.
