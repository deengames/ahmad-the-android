# Ali the Android

Distant-future sci-fi narrative horror roguelike/metroidvania fusion built around learning/mastering abilities.

# Game Design

- **Goal:** Ship something small, like *really* small. Fuse metroidvania with roguelike.

- 10 floors in total
	- The first eight floors are four pairs of new-skill, master-skill
	- The ninth floor combines everything together
	- The tenth/final floor adds a final boss
- User experience goals:
  - Feels like an awesome, strategic UX. You die because you made a mistake.
  - At the same time, when you win, you feel really smart/powerful/innovative.
- The four skills for the four floors:
	- Charge attack (waits a turn, additional knockback and maybe splash)
	- Mini-missile (breaks breakable walls, explosion damage)
	- Electric (bounces to nearby enemies, can short-circuit/unlock doors)
	- Forcefield (damages in a circle around you and pushes enemies away)
	- Plasma rifle (3-4 shots on one target)
- Other traversal upgrades:
	- Teleport drone (shoot it 3-5 squares away to teleport there, hits walls though)
	- Anti-toxic suit upgrade for deep levels
- Backtracking is required to get stuff

# Content + Spoilers

## THEMES
- Theme should fit the core gameplay. which is what?
- Descending. Exploring.
- Killing monsters that kill you.
- Finding and assimilating alien technology.

## STORY
- You are sent to a derelict space station in the middle of deep space
- This station was a research station. They were researching some sort of cure
- Communication went dark a couple of weeks ago. No messages.
- You arrive and find it busted up - debris (breakable walls), no power (locked doors), plasma drive leaks (plasma rooms)
- NB: first floor with plasma, AI voice in ear says "be careful Trace, I detect plasma waves."
- NB: once assimilated, voice should tell you "oh I can do X things now" eg. destroy debris or teleport gaps or whatever

## DATA CUBES BELOW
- It's Umbrella Corp. They're buildling a super-healing thing.
- But there was a conflict. The Captain wanted a weapon. Scientists disagreed.
- There was an accident. Was it sabotaged? Somehow, the prototype leaked, and infected the crew.
- The guards - they turned into zugs. They blew out the engine ...
- The Captain holed himself up on the last floor (captain's log). He may still be there ...

## ENDING
- ... He's the worst mutant of all. He got infected, tried the cure, so he HEALS HIMSELF. Ugh.
- You have the cure. Your captian calls. Choose: tell them you found it? Or, it's too dangerous ...
