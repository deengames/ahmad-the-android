# Ahmad the Android

Distant-future sci-fi narrative horror roguelike/metroidvania fusion built around learning/mastering abilities.

# Game Design

- **Goal:** Ship something small, like *really* small. Fuse metroidvania with roguelike.

- Backstory: ship attacked, crashed on planet, beat the queen (maybe she stole a critical ship part).
- 10 floors in total
	- The first eight floors are four pairs of new-skill, master-skill
	- The ninth floor combines everything together
	- The tenth/final floor adds a final boss

- The four skills for the four floors:
	- Charge attack (waits a turn, additional knockback and maybe splash)
	- Bomb attack: bombs an area around you and destroys walls/blocks
	- Rocket: like a launchable bomb, explosive area damage
	- Freeze: 
		- Freezes enemies (unkillable shadows who don't die but disappear when out-of-sight)
		- When shot over liquids (lava/water), freezes them for a few turns
	- (optional) space jump: jumps ~3 tiles.
	- Other optional upgrades like health, power/damage, etc.
- Jump (upgradable range)
- Grappling hook (upgradable range)
- Backtracking
  - Floors < bomb floor, which have bomb-locked doors
  - Floors < rocket floor, which have rocket-locked doors
  - Floors < freeze floor, which have lava-surrounded doors
  - Make sure at least one of these is necessary to succeed (eg. put the rocket behind a bomb door and freeze behind a rocket-door) but make sure backtracking is either fun or quick.

# Content + Spoilers

- You are an android with lots of missing memories (you explode when you die)
- You're a prototype, so you power up as you go
- Your last body was destroyed, so you start from zero
- You're also a fantastic engineer, so you can reclaim ancient civilizations' artifacts and integrate them into your system
- You were sent here because ... well. You're the android. Your previous, human version came here on a suspicion that The Good Guys are captured a powerful alien and are trying to weaponize it. So he came, and found it, and they used it on him.
- He didn't die. He fused into it and became a hideous creature. With all your powers and intelligence at his disposal.
- Your superiors sent you as an android, because you're the best. You have to defeat yourself.
- Fight hideous mutogenic creatures. It's like a narrative horror sci-fi metroidvania roguelike.
