# Ali the Android

Distant-future sci-fi narrative horror roguelike/metroidvania fusion built around learning/mastering abilities.

# Game Design

- **Goal:** Ship something small, like *really* small. Fuse metroidvania with roguelike.

- Backstory: ship attacked, crashed on planet, beat the queen (maybe she stole a critical ship part).
- 10 floors in total
	- The first eight floors are four pairs of new-skill, master-skill
	- The ninth floor combines everything together
	- The tenth/final floor adds a final boss
- User experience goals:
  - Feels like an awesome, strategic UX. You die because you made a mistake.
  - At the same time, when you win, you feel really smart/powerful/innovative.
- The four skills for the four floors:
	- Charge attack (waits a turn, additional knockback and maybe splash)
	- Mini-missile (breaks breakable walls, explosion damage)
	- Electric (bounces to nearby enemies, can short-circuit/unlock doors)
	- Forcefield (damages in a circle around you and pushes enemies away)
	- Plasma rifle (3-4 shots on one target)
- Other traversal upgrades:
	- Teleport drone (shoot it 3-5 squares away to teleport there, hits walls though)
	- Anti-toxic suit upgrade for deep levels
- Backtracking is required to get stuff

# Content + Spoilers

- You are an android with lots of missing memories (you explode when you die)
- You're a prototype, so you power up as you go
- Your last body was destroyed, so you start from zero
- You're also a fantastic engineer, so you can reclaim ancient civilizations' artifacts and integrate them into your system
- You were sent here because ... well. You're the android. Your previous, human version came here on a suspicion that The Good Guys are captured a powerful alien and are trying to weaponize it. So he came, and found it, and they used it on him.
- He didn't die. He fused into it and became a hideous creature. With all your powers and intelligence at his disposal.
- Your superiors sent you as an android, because you're the best. You have to defeat yourself.
- Fight hideous mutogenic creatures. It's like a narrative horror sci-fi metroidvania roguelike.
